# jbenet/todo

A public TODO list for [jbenet](github.com/jbenet).

I'm reaching the point where there's so many things I need to do that I'm not
getting to fast enough. If I've told you I would do something, and it's
something we can discuss publicly with the whole world, you're welcome
to file an issue here, and i'll get to it as soon as I can.

I may close requests I don't intend to fulfill.

**Product request**: I would love a p2p version of github issues on top of
[ipfs](http://ipfs.io).
